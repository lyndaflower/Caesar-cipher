## Description
Caesar cipher is a type of substitution in which each letter is shifted a certain 
number of places also known as a key, down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be 
replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. For more information on it, you can check this out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher.
